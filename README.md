# Neural Networks and Dark Matter Approximations

This repository contains 2 variations of a neural network to approximate the mass
of dark matter halos in Illustris, given only the observable properties. The first
variation is a Deep Neural Network, which outputs a single number for each halo
mass prediction. The second variation is a Kernel Mixture Network, which outputs
a probability density function for each halo mass prediction. Please refer to
the README.md in each directory for details.
